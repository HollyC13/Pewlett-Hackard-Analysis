# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7: Employee Database with SQL

## Project Overview
Preparation and analysis of employee data in anticipation of upcoming employee retirements including identification of employees
likely to retire based on age (dates of birth in 1952 through 1955), level of impact to departments/departmental management based on number of departmental employees
reaching retirement age and their current positions, and identification of younger employees to be targeted for mentorship opportunities.
This stage of the analysis focused on upcoming retirements by title and the group to be targeted for a proposed mentorship program.

## Results
A review of upcoming retirements by title showed:
-  90,000 employees likely to retire based on their current age
-  A significant number of these employees are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff, accounting for 64% of total anticipated retirements

A review of employees to be targeted for a mentorship program showed:
-  About 1,500 employees in the current target group
-  54% of the current target group have a title of Senior Engineer or Senior Staff

## Summary
-  How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

	With 240,124 current employees, a potential loss of 90,000 employees, even over the course of several years, is significant.  A
	breakdown of the 90,000 employees, based on date of birth, shows they are relatively evenly distributed:
	- 1952: 21,209
	- 1953: 22,857
	- 1954: 23,228
	- 1955: 23,104

	Additional review of these employees including length of service could provide further insight on anticipated retirement dates.


-  Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

	Based on the departmental counts below, there are enough retirement-ready employees available to mentor younger employees, provided
	the program is implemented in the near future.
